# Bayesian Neural Networks in PyTorch

This repository includes my own PyTorch implementations of a few variational inference algorithms for Bayesian neural networks:
* Bayes-by-Backprop (BBB) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05424.pdf
* Matrix Variate Gaussian (MVG) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.04733.pdf
* Multiplicative Normalizing Flows (MNF) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01961.pdf
* Bayes-by-Hypernet (BBH) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.01297.pdf

Unfortunately, the BBH implementation is not currently working. `Example.ipynb` shows each algorithm applied to a toy regression problem.
